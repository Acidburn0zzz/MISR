# MISR
Exploratory Project on Multiple-Image Super-Resolution for the Autumn 2020 IFT6145 Computer Vision course at Université de Montréal.

Explores the use of optical flow in mutiple-image super-resolution. This method should be similar to what is used by other projects such as the commonly known Nvidia DLSS 2.0.
